## src Files:
* assignment2.java: contains an implementation of MGPSO.
* nvpso.java: contains the implementation of NVPSO.
* mopBenchmark.java: contains known multi-objective optimisation problems zdt1, zdt2 and zdt3.
* copBenchmark.java: contains the multi-objective optimisation problems derived from the constrained optimisation problems g01, g04, g07, g08 and g09.
* cop.java: contains the constrained optimisation problems g01, g04, g07, g08 and g09.
* particle.java: contains the implementation of a particle data type.

## Executing the Code:
To run MGPSO for the suite of benchmark problems (g01, g04, g07, g08 and g09).  
$ javac assignment2.java  
$ java assignment2  

To run NVPSO on a specific benchmark function, open nvpso.java & uncomment the benchmark function that you intend to use.  
$ javac nvpso.java  
$ java nvpso
